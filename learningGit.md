What is Git?
-a system that tracks changes to the files of a project over time
-used by many people to efficiently work together and collaborate on team projects where:
    -each person can have their own version of the project which can later be adapted into the main version 
    -different versions of the projects from different people can be managed and coordinated

<Commit>
-snapshots or milestones along thhe timeline of a Git project
-used to capture the state of a project at that exact point in time
-similar to a "history" feature on web browsers

<Branches>
-alternative environments
-often used to experiment unfinished, potentially buggy features in seperate branches, without committing to affecting the master (main) version of the project
